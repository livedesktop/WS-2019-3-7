Backgammon is a member of the tables family, one of the oldest classes of board games in the world.\r\nBackgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice). While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, the better player will accumulate the better record over series of many games, somewhat like poker. With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent.

Like fun draw and guess group games? Selfie Games is for you!\r\n\r\nNOTE:  Heads up, this is the central TV app (for PC or Xbox One).  You will also need to use your phone as the controller to snap selfies and draw something\r\n\r\n-- SELFIE GAMES --\r\n\r\nSelfie Games is a set of fun selfie-infused casual group party games for kids, teens, or adults, a way for you to use your phones to goof off, have fun, and make memories together in person!\r\n\r\nEach player uses their phone (via the mobile app or by visiting our website) to snap selfies, draw something, write, guess, and more.  Then everything is revealed to everyone at the same time on your shared screen!\r\n \r\nIt’s easy for players to join the fun, each player just goes to play.slfi.tv (or opens the mobile app) and enters the 6-digit game pass they see on the screen (then snaps some selfies :) ). \r\n\r\n-- SKETCHIES -- \r\n\r\nSketchies is the first addicting drawing game available in Selfie Games, where you draw absurd doodles of your friends, write ridiculous captions for those doodles, and then try your hardest to guess which was correct.  And you laugh a lot as they all appear on your shared screen.\r\n\r\nTo start, each player gets a fun unusual prompt on their telephone, something like “peter shaves his head with butter while playing charades” or “rich rides a velociraptor while playing pictionary” then does their best to draw it.  (It will be hard to draw, but that’s expected!)\r\n\r\nThen, you write fun fake captions for the other player’s drawings to fool people into guessing them.\r\n\r\nFinally, you guess which caption you think was the original.  You score when you guess something right and whenever you fool your friends into guessing your caption! \r\n\r\nSketchies works for multiplayer groups of 3 player to 10 players (kids, teens, and adults) and has over 500 fun prompts to draw and guess!\r\n\r\n-- IMPORTANT NOTES -- \r\n\r\n- IN APP PURCHASE: While the app is free to join games, at least one player who is playing needs to make the in-app purchase in the mobile app to unlock the ability to host Sketchies games.\r\n\r\n- EASY TO JOIN ON YOUR PHONE: Heads up, each player will need a phone or tablet to play to draw something.  They can join by visiting play.slfi.tv or with the mobile app.\r\n\r\n- FUN FOR ALL AGES: While adult groups can choose to draw something in a dirty taboo way or write dirty taboo captions for people to guess, Selfie Games is fun for groups of kids, teens, or adults.\r\n\r\n- YOUR FACE IS IN THE GAME: Heads up, as you face off your head appears in the drawings making it hard not to laugh when the drawings appear on the central TV to guess!\r\n\r\n- DRAW WITH MULTIPLE COLORS: When drawing in the app you can draw something with multiple colors!\r\n\r\n- ADDICTING MULTIPLAYER GAME:  Multiplayer action for groups of 3 player to 10 player (kids, teens, or adults) in this draw and guess group game.

Backgammon is a board game in which you move the pieces around the board according to dice rolls. Once you get all the pieces in the house you take them out according to your dice. The first player to get all the pieces out wins the game.\r\nDownload and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ challenging AI\r\n\r\n✓ auto bear off\r\n\r\n✓ easy to select and move pieces\r\n\r\n✓ fluid animations \r\n\r\n✓ HD graphics\r\n\r\n✓ detailed statistics\r\n\r\n✓ nice music and sound effects\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Your pieces are white and your opponent's pieces are black. There are 24 places on the board and two places to deposit the pieces. The 24 places are represented as triangles and called points. So the 1-point is the first place where pieces can stay. \r\n\r\n✓ The points from 1 to 6 are called the opponents’ home and the points from 19 to 24 are your home on the board. The opponent needs to bring all his pieces in the home region in order to take them out and so do you.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move around the board in one direction. You move from the bottom-right corner to the bottom-left corner then to the top-left corner and finally to the top-right corner on a path that resembles a horseshoe. The points from 1 to 24 follow this path in the same direction. Your opponent moves in the opposite direction following this path. \r\n\r\n✓ The game starts with a couple of dice rolls that decide which player should begin first. The opponent rolls first, then you. The one with the biggest pips’ count on the dice starts first. A pip is a dot on the face of a dice which counts as a point of movement or placement.\r\n\r\n✓ When your turn comes you start by rolling the dice and continue by making the moves.\r\n\r\n✓ If you roll a double your pips count will be twice the pips�� sum of the dice.\r\n\r\n✓ After you roll the dice some top pieces on your triangles, will be highlighted. You can start your move with any of those highlighted pieces. To move the pieces, you select the piece by tapping on the triangle on which it lies. Then, at that point the triangle turns blue and the places to which you can move next turn green. Tap on any of those green triangles to initiate the move. When the move ends and if there are moves left on the dice new pieces will be highlighted.\r\n\r\n✓ If one of your dice is one you can move one of your pieces only one position. If the piece lies on 2-point you can move it on 3-point for example. If you roll a double, you can make four moves with the same value of the dice from that roll.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move your pieces to columns occupied by your pieces, to empty places or places in which your opponent has one piece. \r\n\r\n✓ If you move your piece over the opponent's single piece you can capture it.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\n\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

In a neighborhood of five houses one is given some clues regarding the habits of the house owners and is asked to identify the one that owns the fish (or zebra).\r\n\r\nIt is said that only 2% of the population is able of finding the solution. I am not sure however, if this percentage refers to the people that are able to solve the puzzle without using a pen and a paper (or a computer). This is indeed very difficult and requires a beyond the average ability to hold too many pieces of information in one's mind at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis application provides an easier way to solve the puzzle. It presents the rules and the board side by side and allows you to easily make selections. It highlights red or green a rule automatically, when it is violated or fulfilled. It also offers easier variations, with fewer houses and properties. The variation presented above is the first one of the 5x5 puzzles. If you solve it and are eager for more, you can find many puzzles with similar difficulty in the '5x5' category.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLL03","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Toca Boo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35509.9007199266427196.a0742277-0f4d-4235-805f-881870ee7be0.4790ad25-088c-4744-9cde-dd94a4af6b32","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7068.9007199266427196.17d3af26-b513-4ce3-ad9f-3b202d037b91.fbb77568-7ddc-4052-b7ff-da4cebf030aa","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1404.9007199266427196.3940dcdf-0ef7-46b4-99c7-fc2e0fa2271c.4b1be38f-db30-49fe-821d-53071efe6d92","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19375.9007199266427196.d0c9827e-647f-4e96-b5c2-999e1c569e9f.be535a6a-14aa-42be-ad31-357cf8fe3a26","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8216.9007199266427196.8875f313-6508-4bee-8d32-17265c79a543.c0ca5ccd-12dd-42b2-9a63-41a3f14ba5e4","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17193.9007199266427196.32065797-4f2b-40df-8bce-6db36b85cb30.dfb063c9-7670-432e-9905-cc45ac53e9a6","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TocaBocaAB.TocaBoo_e8swm3qhs311t"],"ContentIds":["ae25ac77-3d59-e39f-5539-54ac9d85662a","acfb155a-452c-ba99-38cf-0d9b2da20667"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"BOO! \r\nDid I scare you!?

New weapons, landscapes, and options galore! Every game session is now even more dynamic and amazing.\r\n\r\nThe core of the game is still the same: entire armies of enemies rush at your defenses, trying to destroy them by any means necessary. But now they’re even more powerful and madder than ever.\r\n\r\nYou’ll have access to older, time-tested turrets, as well as completely new types of weapons. It’s up to you to decide how to spend your available budget. Should you build new towers or upgrade and fortify the ones you already have? Turrets vary in terms of their attack range, firing speed, and damage type. The only way to win is to combine them so that they complement and strengthen one another.\r\n\r\nThe flexible difficulty settings will allow every player to get as much enjoyment out of the game as possible. If you’re an experienced commander, you’ll love the merciless, intense battles where the countdown where even a fraction of a second is vital to success and everything hinges on your ability to choose and arrange your turrets wisely. If you’re a new player, you’ll easily be able to train and prepare yourself for serious battles.\r\n\r\nEither way, the thoughtfully designed maps and wide range of available turrets will provide you with virtually endless tactical options. Thanks to the stunning, detailed landscapes, painstakingly drawn towers, and incredible special effect, you won’t be able to take your eyes off the screen.\r\n\r\nAll aspects of the game have been meticulously balanced, including tower statistics, enemy strength, terrain characteristics, and special weapons. You’ll never get bored by too-easy gameplay. Every level will challenge you. Are you ready to accept the challenge?\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n• Four difficulty levels\r\n• Eight kinds of turrets\r\n• Eight special abilities, from Air Strikes to Nuclear Bombs\r\n• Varied seasons and

Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ2SM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Classic Solitaire (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41687.9007199266246012.874ed23e-cbcb-48e3-8e84-29257adf5226.1a8de7f4-ee66-4e57-813b-cd84929d1a45","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19041.9007199266246012.874ed23e-cbcb-48e3-8e84-29257adf5226.4da23999-1770-4d33-8720-ade06afa2fa1","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20863.9007199266246012.874ed23e-cbcb-48e3-8e84-29257adf5226.c8d01825-fbf2-4760-9884-a5fea7269a95","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["470AlexeiGarbuzenko.ClassicSolitaireFree_gd2qghq4jdjcm"],"ContentIds":["7420aa68-246b-8f95-630e-2283ae1ef1ff","475e5ff9-89be-a6fe-1054-33ebc1030502","d5204502-f5f8-59b5-f832-bb031e44d5ba","bbdc6f04-fb0d-3ecb-e8b7-e88a38ce90c9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Old good Solitaire implementation for retro lovers!

FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N91FGVDK7VK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Rovercraft Racing - Build your space car!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65405.13541657188736854.cbb78f93-ece1-4a89-97ee-eca4c4f5ee0b.126823e1-888c-4961-8f47-20ed399a50f3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45861.13541657188736854.3e3ca607-0f78-458a-bbcb-8892935455e0.811a2f8f-6854-48ef-a3f7-0a06b2f88f36","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1029.13541657188736854.b500ae50-aa9c-48a0-b594-9b9854c790be.0c990e5d-637c-4f6c-aabb-f2b7dd22beec","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11172.13541657188736854.56640736-b910-4253-8d1c-23651213c443.56ff7481-b0af-49a2-9704-46a47232585f","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62299.13541657188736854.8d20cc9b-81b1-4d8d-a690-42a89e23f1c7.b61cf06c-2c06-4654-b8c0-f3fc2f6f847e","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33880.13541657188736854.3b1670f4-ce82-4736-9d7d-c3714ce3c12b.dc55f7c7-3ed0-4010-97e9-3a26c2b56529","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5787.13541657188736854.42358aa1-6e0d-48da-9e82-bf1950886ae6.d2724268-c25b-4f92-ae3d-b334e658fc15","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37327.13541657188736854.ef619f58-0b61-41e9-a4b4-ea6925c310d5.db81ffea-f753-4a95-9912-a66db9817b83","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36937.13541657188736854.7608d7a8-7e15-4997-91ea-ddb9a5545e1a.7e2bf4a5-6170-4bfe-b45d-6980636d4aa0","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["MobirateLtd.RovercraftRacing-Buildyourspacecar_6pzwjj0ehr79j"],"ContentIds":["ac442293-386a-b893-95e1-97ca92abfc38","6dd6441f-2e0d-9b6c-81c4-3f519666f4d2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play The World Famous Car Crafting Runner with already millions of downloads in the US !

On top of the downturned cards, an upturned card is dealt on the left-most downturned pile, and downturned cards on the rest until all piles have an upturned card. The piles should look like the figure to the right.\r\n\r\nThe four foundations (light rectangles in the upper right of the figure) are built up by suit from Ace (low in this game) to King, and the tableau piles can be built down by alternate colors, and partial or complete piles can be moved if they are built down by alternate colors also. Any empty piles can be filled with a King or a pile of cards with a King. The aim of the game is to build up a stack of cards starting with 2 and ending with King, all of the same suit. Once this is accomplished, the goal is to move this to a foundation, where the player has previously placed the Ace of that suit. Once the player has done this, they will have \"finished\" that suit, the goal being, of course, to finish all suits, at which time the player would have won. There are different ways of dealing the remainder of the deck:\r\n\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste, either allowing three passes through the deck or placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once, reversing the order of each group of three as the cards are dealt.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but only passing through the deck once.\r\nTurning only one card at a time, but placing no limit on passes through the deck.\r\nTurning three cards at once to the waste with no limit on passes through the deck, but allowing the player to switch once to a single pass through the deck one card at a time; after that single pass, however, the player cannot go back to turning three cards at a time and can turn over no more cards from the waste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5KZPG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Modern Taxi Driver 2016","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24882.13510798887164167.de68c2b0-55a5-409f-b58d-452c8ba2b934.a485b2d6-be39-4cd2-8e80-cdd40170e119","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13700.13510798887164167.21c75326-0226-47ab-89a7-6727e242e202.19e2da39-aa35-4c48-a8d4-9182eb0c6eef","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1033.13510798887164167.e8b69fd5-065b-48d7-99cc-46906af33c77.6cd48a23-f24a-42c2-bfe3-33d90b7f6fa7","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["56499UkArtsGames.ModernTaxiDriver2016_ep77ya5xk0qyg"],"ContentIds":["5dec3342-5843-a409-2307-1580a90d3be2","1be09819-46a5-a77f-725d-e7e1883ccccd"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"What is Modern Taxi Driver 2016 all about?\r\nAre you a fan of high speeds taxi driving?

The king, unable to reconcile himself with the hopeless union, sent his son on a crusade and, in his absence, drove his young wife out of the castle. The king had counted on the fact that the prince would eventually forget about her, but his plans were ruined when his heir died in battle, and the prince’s beloved wife gave birth to a child and died in confinement.
