It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH338DR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Rummy 500!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35551.13510798885015984.0ce579a9-ce84-420b-b76f-8f666be2b913.29ce63d2-182e-4cd5-9bee-b3b2d90e8edc","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5123.13510798885015984.ded3d1bc-d54c-4c71-b40e-de8897284bf2.3f1a21cb-a6aa-41b8-8938-a5dbe1214784","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62650.13510798885015984.e4e0e391-44e7-4d4a-8700-6cbd13f6d1d5.55440215-83bd-4fb4-a543-3a397471758d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45230.13510798885015984.0cb3abe8-1edb-4591-bc3c-ed1fba00e4f7.6360537d-69ec-4e42-b2ca-d60fc61a5256","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52875.13510798885015984.99533582-d97a-41dc-b91e-b58b23ddb174.e7b713cc-ad83-4495-8a41-f227cacc78db","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57547.13510798885015984.4ebc7f58-0850-44ac-8b1b-f32c2e680fb6.248311b9-1414-47a7-9bc8-81005cf66daf","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38237.13510798885015984.d266efd1-72dd-4c96-ae42-dcae8fe69a71.f0c0b5ad-44c8-49d5-8e18-b3275b642bd7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55149.13510798885015984.3e1b4e36-8149-40a3-87d5-89d58a5d18f2.1026316b-7011-4ff3-9e98-df43ed509a70","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53906.13510798885015984.a1e0666c-fcf8-4773-9708-a358000cdc8f.400f031d-e6d0-4d79-b670-d776d25a32be","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61976.13510798885015984.4cb197d1-546c-4f26-8602-4ef6a0ae2fb4.1ca632f1-b803-41af-bced-e38bb7d1d34e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"60","PackageFamilyNames":["TrivialTechnology.UltimateRummy500_0ynvawc60ma20"],"ContentIds":["01831087-a441-f5d7-0109-c5940a762685","0f94574c-eb97-344d-ff3a-89a0ebd3a91e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Challenge yourself with Rummy 500, the classic card game!\r\n\r\nNow with a brand new Online Multiplayer mode!

He must play either the next card in sequential order or a wild '*' card, using either cards in hand, the top card of his stock pile, or the top card of any of his four discard piles. If the player can play all five cards from hand, he draws five more and continues playing. When no more plays are available, the player discards one card to either an empty discard pile or on top of an existing one and play passes to the next player. When a build pile reaches 12, it is removed from the board and that space becomes empty for another pile to be started; play continues until one player has played his final start card.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBRNT6SLHC3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Endless Fables 2: Frozen Path","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61913.13578023115888926.bf9c0c9d-413c-4d6e-a8f7-d3e28b796dc5.6ba3e4fc-11bf-49d9-bff2-7bca125debb0","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4552.13578023115888926.03973e1b-15a7-46ef-ae20-cea89b56ddeb.677f3169-455e-4eb6-bd96-cda8b540c366","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62247.13578023115888926.5d345429-4c33-43a1-b553-4900a4ef84ea.837b7e9a-22ea-4edc-912a-8c75c6775c87","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.6,"RatingsCount":"55","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.EndlessFables2FrozenPath_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["a34deea5-a5f1-41c6-d682-739704e55d58","e8558279-3cf5-9c0e-4e51-42d2d519e259","ec539e7b-f3b3-bcf5-20c4-037b2dca572b","6c10cd52-2089-13c1-8ec8-b1b21f738372"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nPamela Cavendish returns for another adventure!

Missing Memories\" - enjoy this adventure game with lots of quests and hidden objects, puzzles and mini-games! Its innovative storyline will grab you right from the beginning and you'll be immersed in a world in which fantasy stands alongside the post apocalyptic reality and every living thing encounters the spreading Darkness. \r\nA young girl Alice has been endowed with a great power, a power of Flame. One day she found an egg in a strange chest. With just one touch, a firebird hatched from it, changing her life forever. From now on, the beautiful bird flowing out of the girl's arm tattoo, withstands the Darkness that has been trying to find it ever since... What power has been given to Alice, and is there a way to harness it?.. From that moment on, Alice is part of the eternal battle between Darkness and Flame. \r\nThe Darkness is keeping approaching and, together with her uncle Colin, Alice sets out on a journey full of wonders and adventures threatening their lives.\r\nAlong with that Colin has been getting trapped in his nightmares over and over again. A woman is begging him for help. Who is she? It turns out that Colin has almost no memory of his childhood and youth. That's because he was among the unlucky ones whose consciousness fell under the shade of the Darkness. \r\nThe man is convinced that after he regains his memories, they will find answers to the most pressing questions. Who is that vaguely familiar woman begging for help?

How long can you survive the arena? Smell the petrol fumes and enjoy the destruction!\r\n\r\nSome of the awesome features of this game:\r\n- Many tracks and race events\r\n- Intense destruction and racing action\r\n- Realistic car damage\r\n- Choose between various all American muscle cars\r\n- Customize and improve your car by earning or buying upgrades\r\n- Choose and modify your car control system to your own preference\r\n- Next to pure demolition events you can race on ovals and dirt tracks\r\n- Smooth 3D graphics and sound effects\r\n\r\nGet ready to race and destroy your opponents in demolition derbies and track races (mini ovals and dirt tracks included) that will offer you the thrill of a lifetime. Destruction has never felt so real as you see doors and other car parts smash of your car. \r\n\r\nSome game-play tips:\r\nHave fun smashing and destroying your adversaries, but understand that the game is a quite accurate simulation of the real thing! In this derby simulator limiting car damage is key to becoming victorious and how you smash into other cars makes a big difference. Always try to smash rivals in the side of their vehicle or from the rear. Head-on collisions on the other hand should be avoided. Practice makes perfect!\r\n\r\nUpgrades:\r\nYou have various cars you can unlock. These all have the pros and cons. Be sure to upgrade your cars wisely as the various type of events require different cars. Use armor upgrades to strengthen your endurance; or engine upgrades to boost your speed. To get your upgrades you earn money during races. The better you perform the more you earn. Before a race you can also buy power-ups to boost your performance during a race. The nitro boost will allow you to accelerate super-fast and smash your opponents even harder; or choose one of the other power-ups such an armor booster to strengthen your car during the race. \r\n\r\nIf you like demolition games this game is made for you!\r\n3, 2, 1 start your download and join the ultimate demolition derby game experience now!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4X4GN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Rento - Realize your monopoly","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20394.13510798887537327.6c020402-3ff8-4dac-93d6-f8d36b3fd868.a8a46c3d-8e2d-425c-a1e9-fa2e7384d1f7","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56160.13510798887537327.6c020402-3ff8-4dac-93d6-f8d36b3fd868.314bac1d-70f7-4576-9776-60832861aaeb","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25.13510798887537327.6c020402-3ff8-4dac-93d6-f8d36b3fd868.3690e2a2-da85-4782-8fa3-8e8e00ea6b74","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22978.13510798887537327.6c020402-3ff8-4dac-93d6-f8d36b3fd868.40c8eb45-ec8a-4b6f-8281-90ef82fc7003","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $6.49","Price":6.49,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"8","PackageFamilyNames":["28846BoardGamesOnline.Rento-MonopolyGameOnline_tjga78qnh0kwj"],"ContentIds":["d1764795-ce08-0a76-8ae4-ca420a70be29","124c9e5b-4f77-4c47-e4e5-e9428d101645"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Rento is multiplayer business dice game.

The computer game was originally created by Brodie Lockard in 1981 and named Mah-Jongg after the game that uses the same tiles for play. Lockard claims that it was based on a centuries-old Chinese game called \"the Turtle\". However, it was not until Activision released Shanghai in 1986 for the Macintosh and Apple IIgs that the game gathered momentum. A version of this game was also included in the Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.x in 1990 and went by the name Taipei. It was subsequently included in the Best of Windows Entertainment Pack. Premium editions of the Windows Vista operating system and Windows 7 include a version of the game known as Mahjong Titans. \r\nAs any other successful game, millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with 60 different layouts in a tiny download package. \r\nA tile that can be moved left or right without disturbing other tiles is said to be exposed. Exposed pairs of identical tiles (Flower and Seasons tiles in the same group being considered identical) are removed from the layout one at a time, gradually exposing the lower layers to play. The aim of the game is to clear the layout by pairing up all the tiles. The game is finished when either the layout is empty, or there are no exposed pairs remaining.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NRFP3P33J5T","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dark Romance: Heart of the Beast","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37391.14388628183839552.396f607e-e763-46e9-a621-ee7bc5791285.218a67fd-995c-4150-91d5-ea6cb213553c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33642.14388628183839552.396f607e-e763-46e9-a621-ee7bc5791285.b60ccc51-0ad0-4671-9a00-9ff0490ca574","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60847.14388628183839552.396f607e-e763-46e9-a621-ee7bc5791285.e358cabf-0d95-41b3-b139-4add804f71c6","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31188.14388628183839552.396f607e-e763-46e9-a621-ee7bc5791285.bf0df670-b641-49a0-962a-abd68309e455","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $12.79","Price":12.79,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.DarkRomanceHeartoftheBeast_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["3fc6f551-e7c8-348c-98fc-dbe9d7f80b4f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Your father’s illness has taken a turn for the worse.

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N4RC6HZ5D38","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tropical Beach Bingo World","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2551.13977566985253821.cd5d4a38-3ad0-4a5d-9c90-76f00d887b09.7b531e7c-4dda-4009-883d-f9422c6df2b3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13622.13977566985253821.cd5d4a38-3ad0-4a5d-9c90-76f00d887b09.9b1205d7-952f-4640-9fa8-f43f3df1dad4","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11937.13977566985253821.cd5d4a38-3ad0-4a5d-9c90-76f00d887b09.8a0a9dca-e040-46dd-aa4b-6bd2918a32b8","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29707.13977566985253821.5c32c09b-40e7-4e8e-a5b4-4c12880766aa.4b67e676-a754-468c-95cd-918207d8f147","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"12","PackageFamilyNames":["10850BlackCircleApps.TropicalBeachBingoWorld_0jpr7k9qyd4tc"],"ContentIds":["cf255354-b9dc-dca8-472b-59e4bbc8e3ca","f7e54c88-45a2-edd3-8408-84ae152c8a1f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Welcome to the Bingo heaven for all those who love bingo, and willing to relax playing your favorite game with nice environmental paradisiac islands.

The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging.
