Fight alongside the Spartan warriors and a select group of heroes from royale Barbarian ! \r\n\r\nWar Heroes Clash Battle Boom TD is the best castle defense game ever ! The war has just begun. Shooting arrows was never so much fun. \r\n\r\nWar Heroes Clash Battle Boom is simple and easy to play, this game is a combination of strategy, magic and some funny jokes. It requires you plan how to barricade your defenses (don’t just build and upgrade everything you can in a random order) and plan your attacks carefully (just sending every soldier you have won’t cut it) in order to win every battle and make your commander - THE COMMANDER.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ ARCHER WARRIOR VS. ARMIES OF THRACKUS ★★★★★\r\n\r\nThe saga of this god of war is well known in greek history. Some say he is son of Zeus. Another legend is that he was sent on earth by Hades, while another tale has it that he is Apollo himself in disguise. With his Hercules strength he stands like a tower between the mighty force of the demon Thrackus and wall of justice. Equipped with god's armor and blessed with super attack speed, he awaits his share of action. He is leader of clan and the mightiest soldier ever seen.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ WEAPONS AND MAGIC ★★★★★\r\n\r\nVariety potions and spells make killing of evil easier and even more fun. Dragon fire, ice effect or missile - you have it all. Equip your mighty sparta hero with the godly weapons and march towards victory. The clash at gate becomes intense and to save yourself from extra pressure, plant some mines close by. Shoot at the smaller units while you freeze big ones like giants. Beware of cannons and tanks that can launch from a distance. \r\n\r\n★★★★★ COMBAT OF HEORES WITH CLAN LORDS ★★★★★\r\n\r\nEach boss have special powers and you will need some devine help to defeat them. When facing a large crush of armies, to counter them, its lethal strategy to unleash heroes in the middle of battle. They are your friends and alliance in thickest of war. They dont fight with bomb and bullet, but prefer sword and hammer. Use them wisely because they can be hired only on a time basis as mercenaries.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ STRIKE AND DEFEND ★★★★★\r\n\r\nAttack is the best form of defence. In combat never loose touch of pressurizing your opponent. Shooting like a sniper is good but some times random fire is a good way to fend of enemies. Angry sparta looks down on the enemy at gate and waits for them to make a move.\r\n\r\nDeploy your army, choose your god and fight amongst in the War Heroes Clash Battle Boom!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PFJHDH2J6XZ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Badminton League","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48172.14204266195686618.f2ff143d-71a8-44df-94ab-d2380d660578.e3244aa8-560f-47ce-9685-dee165f71e25","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53112.14204266195686618.f2ff143d-71a8-44df-94ab-d2380d660578.c9c55e1c-22ed-44ee-bf65-09914214c0da","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48172.14204266195686618.f2ff143d-71a8-44df-94ab-d2380d660578.e3244aa8-560f-47ce-9685-dee165f71e25","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["40033HappyPlaygendaryStud.BadmintonLeague_5fb8cdwjrfnej"],"ContentIds":["fb7d9c97-d196-7f11-08fb-10dcf7ce850a","932a9530-86d1-cd02-190d-0862595d7875"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The most competitive badminton games ever!

You can only collect the maximum number of prizes if you find the optimal solution. Every move you make off of the optimal path moves all the prizes one step nearer to the exit and possibly out of the maze. When you find the optimal solution for a maze at one level you will move onto the next level. The next level will have more 'cells' but might have an optimal solution with fewer moves since the mazes are randomly generated as needed.\r\n\r\nYou can move through the maze by dragging the avatar, by using the thumb-friendly arrow buttons at the side of the screen, or by using a mouse or keyboard (if attached).\r\n\r\nYou can zoom into the maze to make moving by dragging easier; but if you do this you can't see the complete maze at one time.\r\n\r\nThere are various themes which you can select or let the app decide on one for you based on the current date (e.g. Easter, Christmas, St. Patrick's Day, Thanksgiving, Halloween).\r\n\r\nYou can make life easier with various feedback options (i.e. showing where the prizes are hidden or changing the appearance of the avatar when off the optimal path). You can let the App show you the optimal solution but if you do this you don't advance to the next level. You can restart the maze at any stage and revert to the state just after doing a new maze. However you can't undo the effects of getting the App to show you the optimal solution by doing this. You will need to create a new maze.\r\n\r\nThe maximum level you can reach depends on the resolution of your device. However when you reach the maximum level you can still get new mazes to solve as each time you select a new maze it is randomly generated on the fly.\r\n\r\nThe application does not connect to the internet and thus cannot share any information about you with others.

The Tetris game was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984—the product of Alexey’s computer programming experience and his love of puzzles. In the decades to follow, Tetris became one of the most successful and recognizable  games, appearing on nearly every gaming platform available. This App is based on the classic Tetris, a new development in windows10!\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE\r\n\r\nThe goal of Tetris is to score as many points as possible by clearing horizontal lines of Blocks. The player must rotate, move, and drop the falling Tetriminos inside the Matrix (playing field). Lines are cleared when they are filled with Blocks and have no empty spaces.\r\n\r\nAs lines are cleared, the level increases and Tetriminos fall faster, making the game progressively more challenging. If the Blocks land above the top of the playing field, the game is over.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NKM5KCDQPPW","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Commander At War:Real-Time World War","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5969.13658533735506354.40111fea-1960-4333-98e4-4bb038422a9b.a21347a7-bf6e-4568-9953-adbab320c59b","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.11204.13658533735506354.40111fea-1960-4333-98e4-4bb038422a9b.ee10ed0e-dfb9-4d5e-a308-9b4327693f89","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61714.13658533735506354.40111fea-1960-4333-98e4-4bb038422a9b.51968e18-5f8b-4d33-a5b5-29aaef232904","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1143.13658533735506354.fbfd077e-f0a7-4afb-832e-0048fce8e060.f4d259c4-094c-447c-963c-478376d8d2eb","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["B9BA84AC.Heroesatwars_3ag0hv5nd203a"],"ContentIds":["c9cb36e9-3b63-d168-2024-64d9222c3151","28e9492f-9120-2398-dc0c-1c9fd6de6172"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Join now with over 1 Million+ commanders!\r\n\r\nNEW Real-Time PVP war game!\r\n\r\nBe the commander of Modern Army! \r\n\r\nCOMMANDER, ALL UNITS UNDER YOUR CONTROL!\r\nCollect your own army, deploy troops, and compete with global players.\r\n\r\nALL THE EPIC UNITS YOU WANT, NOW WITH AIR FORCES\r\n50+ epic army units, all designed with its unique purpose!

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!
